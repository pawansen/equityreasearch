              </div>
              <p class="pera_bottom_20">Atlantic Capital Advisors (“AC Advisors”) is a capital manager specializing in residential mortgage and other real estate related investments.  The anagement team at Atlantic Capital Advisors founded a ACM Financial Trust in 1998, which remained its sole management duty until 2007 when they formed Hatteras Financial, which they took pubic in 2008 (NYSE: HTS).  AC Advisors managed both REITs until the sale of Hatteras in 2016 and continue to manage the original privately held REIT.</p>
              <p class="pera_bottom_20"> 
The REIT model we execute appeals to the conservative investor in search of investment stability and income. We attempt to provide a diversification tool for asset allocation strategies which generates a higher risk-adjusted rate of return than traditional fixed-income alternatives.</p>
              <p class="pera_bottom_20">Our long history has allowed us to build strong relationships with non-bank mortgage originators, major commercial banks, leading investment banks, law firms and other asset managers. </p>

                <h2>Benefits Of ACA</h2>
              </div>
              <p class="pera_bottom_20">Management has extensive experience in Capital Markets, Fixed Income Sales and Trading, Asset/Liability Management and Mortgage Banking.  Our experience also comprises multiple housing cycles and interest rate environments</p>
              <p class="pera_bottom_20">Employing shareholder friendly fee structure based off equity value gives our shareholders a unique benefit compared to other fee structures based on AUM or performance hurdles.  This better aligns our interests with that of our shareholders minimizing the incentive to take extraordinary risks for additional potential return not commensurate with the additional risk.</p>
              <p class="pera_bottom_20">Investors benefit from our experience managing a public company.  Procedures and controls reflect the policies of a public company along with having an independent board of directors, our preference to use nationally recognized accounting firms as auditors, and use of major commericial banks for items such as securities custodian.</p>
              <p class="pera_bottom_20">Long standing lender partnerships provide insight into primary mortgage markets and new product creation</p>
